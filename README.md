This repository contains my hands-on practice while learning Spring Boot.
The goal of this repository is to build a strong foundation by implementing concepts step by step through small examples and mini-projects.

I use this space to experiment, break things, fix them, and gain a deeper understanding of how Spring Boot works in real-world applications.
